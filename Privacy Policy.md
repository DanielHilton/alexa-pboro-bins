# Privacy Policy for Alexa Peterborough Bins Skill

## Key details

This privacy policy describes how the developer protects and makes use of the information you give when you use this skill.

To use the skill, it requires that you speak to Alexa, and responses will be received aloud. Therefore any communication to Alexa will be treated as a communication authorised by you, and any communication via the Alexa skill in response to a request received from Alexa will be treated as a communication to you.

You are responsible for all of the interactions with the Alexa voice skill. For this reason it is imperative that you consult the agreements that you have in place with Amazon to ensure that you are using Alexa safely and correctly.

## Security

Once you set up your Alexa voice skill, you are authorising Alexa to provide information to the skill. This means that you are responsible for how the Alexa voice skill is used, including any communication to or from the skill itself.

To prevent unauthorised disclosure or access to your information, we rely on Alexa's (Amazon's) physical and electronic security safeguards.

## Data

The Peterborough Bins skill collects and uses your Alexa device's configured country and postcode. It only uses the postcode to pass into the request to Peterborough City Council's bin collection website. This allows the skill to get information relevant to where you live.

Any personal information we hold about you is stored and processed in line with the Data Protection Act 1988.

The skill does not store your name or full address.

## Cookies

## Changes or amendments:

We may change, suspend, or discontinue the skill, or any part of it, at any time without notice. This policy is updated from time to time.
Your continued use of the skill after the effective date of the revised Terms constitutes acceptance of the Terms.
